| 5. An unordered list `<ul>` is used to create the navigation links.                                                               | ✅       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | I'm using a `<ul>` on every page to create the list of navigation links. Inside them is a list of `<li>` elements, which contain an anchor (`<a>`) element, linking to the corresponding page                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6.

The image is from unsplash, a site that provides free copyright license of all their images, meaning they can be used for both non-commercial and commercial purposes without need for attribution. However, in order to fairly accredit the photographer, and ensure any work not produced by me is referenced correctly, I have included the recomended attribution in the figure caption.

| 1. All the pages should share the same external CSS file. Justifications are provided (as code comment) for internal or inline CSS formatting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ✅       |                                                                                                                                                                                           | All pages use the same style.css file. All styling is done via this file. Default user agent styles may still be present, but some have been overridden, such as margin on header elements, and the list styling of the `<ul>` navigation                                                                             |
| 2. CSS flex is used to place the navigation links horizontally. Class is used to apply CSS flex to the navigation links only and not other `<ul>` element. The links should use all the horizontal space.                                                                                                                                                                                          | ✅       | [d7a2882](https://github.com/Ben-Bromley/UON-COMP-Coursework-2/commit/d7a2882235310ce26a1923586b7ca62cfcb34032#diff-b78be019f1dc6d57753ea900c3805b114cd53ab7c0db836cc081836df1b99b7a) | I've added `display: flex;` to `header nav {}` to arrange the links horizontally. I've used `header nav ul li {}` to add some margin / spacing to the links.

| 3. Location selector is used to remove the bullet in front of the navigation links. Class or ID is not allowed for this. This should only remove the bullets from the navigation links and not any other unordered list items.                                                                                                                                                                     | ✅       | [d7a2882](https://github.com/Ben-Bromley/UON-COMP-Coursework-2/commit/d7a2882235310ce26a1923586b7ca62cfcb34032#diff-b78be019f1dc6d57753ea900c3805b114cd53ab7c0db836cc081836df1b99b7a) | I've used the location selector `header nav ul li {}` to remove the default list bullets from the navigation links alone                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If they select a person, then all the inputs for the owners attributes will be prefilled with the existing data and the inputs disabled (this is just intended to show the user that they don't need to input the remaining data manually). When handling the form submission, if the user has selected a person, it will retrieve the People record using the `getPersonByID` helper method. If the user has selected "new person" then the remaining person attribute inputs will be required to be filled in. That data is passed to `createPerson` and will then be inserted into a new record in the People table |
