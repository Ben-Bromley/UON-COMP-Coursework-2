| 1. The user should be able to look up people by their names or their driving licence number (by typing either of these in to the system). If the person is not in the system it should give an appropriate message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ✅       | [2fc586d](https://github.com/Ben-Bromley/UON-COMP1004-Coursework-2/commit/2fc586d900807f11b5b12606829d44175c753e9a) | Using `getElementById` and `addEventListener` I've extracted the value from the text input when the form is submitted for us in the supabase JavaScript client                                                                                                                   |
| 1a. This search should not be case sensitive and it should work on partial names, e.g., “John”, “Smith” and “John Smith” would all find John Smith. If there are several people with the same name they should all be listed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✅       | [a77ddb5](https://github.com/Ben-Bromley/UON-COMP1004-Coursework-2/commit/a77ddb518b45a11f8dbb24a2b105b3e9af1020d0) | I've used the `ilike` method from supabase in order to do a case-insensitive search                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2. The user should be able to look up vehicle registration (plate) number. The system will then show details of the car (e.g., type, colour etc.), the ownerʼs name and license number. Allow for missing data in the system (e.g., the vehicle might not be in the system, or the vehicle might be in the system but the owner might be unknown).                                                                                                                                                                    | ✅       | [43dcfc6](https://github.com/Ben-Bromley/UON-COMP1004-Coursework-2/commit/43dcfc69ffba97119ff383363cc5c704f65e0315) | Using a similar function to requirement 1, I handle a basic form submission, and use the data to query supabase via the JS API                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3. The user should be able to enter details for a new vehicle. This will include the registration (plate) number, make, model and colour of the vehicle, as well as its owner. If the owner is already in the database, then it should be a matter of selecting that person and assigning them to the new vehicle. If the owner is not in the database they should be added (along with personal information including the license number).                                                                           | ✅       | [6a17bef](https://github.com/Ben-Bromley/UON-COMP1004-Coursework-2/commit/6a17befbbab8c9d553eedc6d6bcdb78ea4e1598c) | I've created a bespoke function called `findOrCreateOwner` which accepts a name, and returns a `People` object with a `PersonID` that can be stored alongside the vehicle information, which I'm accessing as properties of `e.target` before submitting via the supabase JS API |
| 4. (Only required for the full mark) The user should be able to file a report for an incident and retrieve existing reports (e.g., via a search). Filing new ones will involve submitting a textual statement, recording the time of the incident and the vehicle and person involved. If either the person or the vehicle are new to the system, then appropriate new entry/entries to the database should be added. An user should be able to record the offence from a list of offences contained in the database. |          |                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
